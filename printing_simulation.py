"""This program is a simulation of the following problem:

On average, there are 10 students in the computer lab in any given hour. There is 1 printer in
this computer lab. On average, each student will need to use the printer twice, and will need
to print between 1 and 20 pages. The printer has two settings: it can print lower quality
at a rate of 10 pages per minute, or higher quality at a rate of 5 pages per minute.

What is the average waiting time per print task for these two methods?
